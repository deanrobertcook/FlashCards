FlashCards
==========

An XML-Based flash card app 


This app is a simple flash-card generator for language learning. From the home screen the user can add new cards and display the lists of cards based upon what type they are (verbs, nouns, adjectives etc). This app is unfinished, and some of the functionality doesn't work. The intent was to also have the cards displayed in a random order and perhaps add some functionality similar to that of the flash-card App "Anki", but I have not continued with this project.
